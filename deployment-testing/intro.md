This example will showcase the implementation of A/B testing.

# What is A/B testing?

A/B (Alpha/Beta) testing is a testing methodology used by developers that involves monitoring the user behavior to help improve a product. The basic idea is to randomly present to the users two variations of something and to see which one performs best.

# Plan for the tutorial

This tutorial will include the usage of 2 versions of the same website. With each of them offering different colors for the button. The goal is to monitor which of the colors encourage the button to be clicked more often. 

# Learning goals:
* A/B Testing
* Using docker containers
* Handling multiple containers with Kubernetes
* Traffic management with Istio
