# Conclusion

CI/CD pipelines are a must-have for companies, without them, it is a cumbersome task for multiple employees to work on the same solution. Furthermore, continuous testing helps to avoid a simple change causing unexpected issues. 

However, for businesses to gain most of their product they almost inevitably would need to use Alpha/Beta testing. It is usually done for small changes in order to reduce the impact that multiple concurrent modifications could have on each other. When properly done it can help improve the product without noticeably affecting the customer.
