# Conclusion
Now that the tutorial is finished you can combine what you have learned here in the CI/CD section and the A/B section to create a pipeline that will directly integrate and deploy A/B testing. You can set it up so that your newest change with be tested againts the currently deployed version. This is quite advanced and since this tutorial aims to cover the basics we did not go over this specific scenario.

CI/CD pipelines are a must-have for companies, without them, it is a cumbersome task for multiple employees to work on the same solution. Furthermore, continuous testing helps to avoid a simple change causing unexpected issues. 

However, for businesses to gain most of their product they almost inevitably would need to use Alpha/Beta testing. It is usually done for small changes in order to reduce the impact that multiple concurrent modifications could have on each other. When properly done it can help improve the product without noticeably affecting the customer. 

Thank you for following our tutorial and we hope you learned something new from it.
